# JSON-CSV-Converter
## Introduction
Jupyter Notebook to convert between JSON and CSV files


## Usage
Place a JSON or CSV file within the same directory as the script. The JSON file must be an Array of Objects or Multidimensional Array.


The script will convert the file, creating a new file with the same basename. If the converted file's name exists a `(1)` will be added to the basename of the converted file.
